Notes:
Track Names are used in AFTER BURNER 20th
Anniversary Box.


The "melody" versions of "After Burner" and
"Final Take Off" are present on several After
Burner soundtracks, but are very rare (if they
even existed) to find on real arcade machines.

The source files were eventually recovered by
Sega and M2 from old development disks and
added as a bonus in the Nintendo 3DS game
3D After Burner II.

I extracted the ROM of the emulated Z80 sound
processor from that game and now the 2 melody
tracks have finally been logged.
